## 2. Overall Validation Status

This report details the initial validation findings for Aditya Sharma. The National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry search successfully identified the provider with matching demographic information, indicating high data quality for NPI purposes.

*   **Verification Status:** ✓ FOUND

### 3.2. Propelus Verification (Professional Licensure)

*   **Verification Source:** Propelus Automated Licensure Verification
*   **Verification Status:** **SKIPPED**
*   **Reason for Skip:** No valid license number was available in the provider's profile to initiate the automated verification process.
*   **Assessment:** Critical primary source verification of the provider's professional license could not be completed through the automated system. This represents a significant and critical gap in the current validation process for this provider, directly impacting credentialing completeness and compliance.

### 3.3. Data Quality Assessment

*   **NPI Data:** High quality and complete. Consistent with expected provider information.
*   **Licensure Data:** **Incomplete**. The absence of a valid professional license number prevents essential primary source verification.
*   **Missing Information Identified:** Valid California medical license number.
*   **Discrepancies/Inconsistencies:** The primary discrepancy is the absence of a valid professional license number. This prevents critical primary source verification through automated systems (Propelus) and is a significant gap in the provider's profile, hindering full credentialing.

## 4. Compliance Status

The absence of primary source verification for professional licensure is a critical compliance concern. This directly impacts the ability to meet NCQA, CMS, and state-specific credentialing requirements. Full credentialing cannot be completed until this essential verification is performed. Immediate action is required to address this gap and ensure the provider meets all necessary regulatory and organizational standards.

## 5. Recommendations & Required Actions

Based on the validation findings, the following immediate and subsequent actions are required:

1.  **Obtain License Number:** Immediately contact Aditya Sharma or the relevant department to obtain the valid California medical license number.
2.  **Manual Licensure Verification:** Once the license number is acquired, perform a manual primary source verification of the California medical license directly with the issuing state board (e.g., Medical Board of California). This is a critical step to ensure compliance.
3.  **Update Provider Profile:** Ensure the obtained license number is accurately entered into the provider's profile to facilitate future automated verifications where applicable and maintain complete records.
4.  **Credentialing Committee Review:** Present this report, along with the results of the manual license verification, to the credentialing committee for a comprehensive review and final decision regarding provider enrollment.
