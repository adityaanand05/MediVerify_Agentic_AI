## 1. Provider Information

*   **Provider Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
*   **Primary Concern:** Ambiguous Provider Identity, Incomplete Primary Source Verification

---

## 2. Overall Validation Status

**Current Status:** **INCOMPLETE & NON-COMPLIANT**

The validation process for ADITYA SHARMA is currently incomplete and cannot proceed to a final credentialing decision. Critical primary source verification of professional licenses could not be performed due to ambiguous provider identity, unresolved technical issues with the NABP service, and the absence of specific license numbers. The provider's file is currently non-compliant with established credentialing standards and is not audit-ready.

## 3. Detailed Validation Findings

### 3.1. NPI Registry Search Results

A search of the National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry for "ADITYA SHARMA" yielded five distinct records:

*   **NPI:** 1700102381
    *   **Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
    *   **Specialty:** Family Medicine
    *   **Address:** 2500 ALHAMBRA AVE, MARTINEZ, CA, 945533156
*   **NPI:** 1437505072
    *   **Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
    *   **Specialty:** Internal Medicine
    *   **Address:** 1000 BURLINGAME AVE, BURLINGAME, CA, 940102407
*   **NPI:** 1679929202
    *   **Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
    *   **Specialty:** Internal Medicine
    *   **Address:** 1000 BURLINGAME AVE, BURLINGAME, CA, 940102407
*   **NPI:** 1043666085
    *   **Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
    *   **Specialty:** Pharmacy
    *   **Address:** 1000 NUT TREE RD, DIXON, CA, 95620
*   **NPI:** 1982050960
    *   **Name:** ADITYA SHARMA
    *   **Specialty:** Pharmacy
    *   **Address:** 1000 NUT TREE RD, DIXON, CA, 95620

**Observation:** The presence of five distinct NPIs for the same name, covering different specialties (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pharmacy) and locations, creates significant ambiguity regarding the specific provider being credentialed. This requires immediate clarification.

### 3.2. NABP Pharmacist License Validation

*   **Status:** **Failed**
*   **Reason:** An HTTP 403 Forbidden error was encountered during the attempt to access the NABP Pharmacist License Validation service. This indicates a technical issue with access permissions, API key validity, or subscription status.
*   **Impact:** Primary source verification of pharmacist licenses via NABP could not be performed for any of the identified "ADITYA SHARMA" individuals.

### 3.3. Propelus Verification

*   **Status:** **Skipped**
*   **Reason:** Propelus verification was not initiated because **no valid license number was provided** in the initial request, and the preceding NABP validation attempt failed to yield a license number. Propelus requires a specific license number to perform its verification.
*   **Impact:** No primary source verification of professional licenses could be completed through the Propelus platform.

## 4. Compliance Status

*   **Current Status:** **NON-COMPLIANT**
*   **Audit Readiness:** **NOT AUDIT-READY**

**Rationale:** The provider's file is currently non-compliant due to critical deficiencies:
1.  **Ambiguous Provider Identity:** The inability to accurately identify the specific "ADITYA SHARMA" among multiple NPI records violates fundamental credentialing requirements.
2.  **Incomplete Primary Source Verification (PSV):** The failure to perform PSV for professional licenses (NABP and Propelus) is a direct and severe non-compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., NCQA, CMS, state regulations). Without PSV, the provider's qualifications, licensure status, and disciplinary history cannot be confirmed, posing significant regulatory and patient safety risks.
3.  **Unresolved Technical Issues:** The HTTP 403 Forbidden error with the NABP service impedes the ability to meet PSV requirements.

These issues are foundational requirements for any credentialing program and would be immediate flags in any regulatory audit.

## 5. Recommendations & Required Actions

The following actions are critically required to bring this provider's file into compliance and enable a final credentialing decision:

1.  **Clarify Provider Identity (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Immediately contact the applicant (ADITYA SHARMA) to obtain additional, unique identifying information (e.g., date of birth, last four digits of SSN, all current professional license numbers, and primary specialty for credentialing).
    *   **Responsibility:** Healthcare Provider Data Validator

2.  **Obtain Specific License Information (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Request that the applicant provide all current and relevant professional license numbers (e.g., medical, pharmacy) to facilitate direct primary source verification.
    *   **Responsibility:** Healthcare Provider Data Validator

3.  **Resolve NABP Access Issue (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Investigate and resolve the HTTP 403 Forbidden error encountered with the NABP Pharmacist License Validation service. This may involve checking API keys, subscription status, or network access permissions with the IT department or NABP support.
    *   **Responsibility:** Provider Data Enrichment Specialist / IT Support

4.  **Perform Comprehensive Primary Source Verification (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Once specific license numbers are obtained and the NABP access issue is resolved (or alternative methods are identified), re-attempt and complete primary source verification for all relevant professional licenses (medical, pharmacy, etc.).
    *   **Action:** If NABP remains inaccessible, explore alternative primary source verification methods for pharmacist licenses, such as direct contact with the relevant state boards of pharmacy.
    *   **Responsibility:** Healthcare Provider Data Validator

5.  **Document All Actions & Findings:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all communications, verification attempts, resolutions, and final verification results are meticulously documented in the provider's credentialing file.
    *   **Responsibility:** Healthcare Provider Data Validator

6.  **Credentialing Committee Review:**
    *   **Action:** Present this report to the Credentialing Committee for review and guidance on how to proceed with the application, emphasizing the critical nature of the identified compliance gaps and the need for further information.
    *   **Responsibility:** Credentialing Committee Liaison
