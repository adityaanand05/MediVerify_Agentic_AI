# Provider Validation Report: Aditya Sharma

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared For:** Credentialing Committee

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Provider Overview
This report details the validation findings for provider Aditya Sharma. Initial data presented multiple National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) associated with two distinct practice profiles: one for "Internal Medicine" at an address in Davis, CA, and another for "Family Medicine" at an address in Martinez, CA.

### Validation Status
**Critical Issues Identified; Not Approved for Credentialing.**
The validation process revealed significant data inconsistencies and critical missing information, leading to an overall "Fail" assessment in the Quality Assurance Review.

### Key Findings
*   **Unverified NPIs:** A large number of NPIs associated with the "Internal Medicine" specialty and Davis, CA address could not be found or verified in the NPI Registry.
*   **Provider Identity Ambiguity:** The presence of one verified NPI (1700102381) for "Family Medicine" at a distinct address, alongside multiple unverified NPIs for "Internal Medicine" under the same name, creates substantial ambiguity regarding the actual provider(s).
*   **Missing Critical Data:** State license numbers, issuing states, license expiration dates, and complete contact information (specifically email) are missing for all identified NPIs.

### Recommendation
**Immediate action required:** The provider's application is currently **not recommended for approval**. Further investigation and verification of provider identity, NPI validity, and acquisition of all missing critical credentialing data are essential. A re-validation and comprehensive QA review will be necessary upon resolution of these issues.

## 4. Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness Score
**Overall completeness for critical fields (Name, NPI, Specialty, Address, License Expiration, Contact Info):** 66.67%

### Consistency Analysis
*   **High Discrepancy:** A significant inconsistency exists with multiple NPIs associated with "ADITYA SHARMA" for "Internal Medicine" at one address, while a separate NPI (1700102381) is verified for "Family Medicine" at a different address. This raises serious questions about whether these records pertain to one individual with multiple practices/specialties or two distinct individuals with the same name.
*   **Unverified Data:** The inability to verify a large number of NPIs associated with the "Internal Medicine" profile severely impacts data consistency and reliability.

### Identified Gaps
*   License expiration status for all NPIs.
*   Contact information (email address for all NPIs, phone number for the unverified NPIs).
*   State license numbers and issuing states for all NPIs.

## 5. Quality Assurance Review

### Compliance Status
**Overall Quality Assessment: Fail**

The provider record for Aditya Sharma fails to meet essential compliance checklist items due to critical missing information and significant data inconsistencies.

### Issues and Concerns
1.  **Unverified NPIs:** The numerous NPIs associated with "ADITYA SHARMA" (Internal Medicine, 1000 OLIVE DR STE 400, DAVIS, CA, 95616) could not be found or verified in the NPI Registry. This is a severe data integrity issue, as these records should not be used until fully validated.
2.  **Missing License Information:** Current and active state license numbers, issuing states, and expiration dates are missing for all NPIs, including the verified NPI 1700102381. This is a fundamental requirement for credentialing and compliance.
3.  **Incomplete Contact Information:** Email addresses are missing for all NPIs. A complete phone number was only found for NPI 1700102381.
4.  **Provider Identity Ambiguity:** The presence of one verified NPI (1700102381, Family Medicine) and multiple unverified NPIs (Internal Medicine) under the same name creates significant ambiguity regarding the actual provider(s). This poses risks for patient safety, accurate referrals, and billing.

### Recommendations
1.  **Provider Identity Verification:** Immediately verify if NPI `1700102381` belongs to the same "Aditya Sharma" as the other NPIs, or if it represents a different individual with the same name. This is crucial for accurate provider identification.
2.  **NPI Validity and Specialty/Address Confirmation:** For each unique NPI identified, confirm its validity and the primary specialty and practice address with authoritative sources (e.g., state licensing boards, NPI registry, direct provider outreach). Specifically, investigate the unverified "Internal Medicine" NPIs to determine their origin and validity.
3.  **License Status Verification:** Obtain and verify the current license status, including state license numbers, issuing states, and expiration dates, for all associated NPIs from the respective state licensing boards.
4.  **Contact Information Acquisition:** Gather and validate complete contact information (phone number, email address) for each distinct provider record.
5.  **Data Consolidation/Separation:** Based on verification, either consolidate the records if it's a single provider with multiple practice locations/specialties, or create separate, distinct profiles if they are different individuals.
